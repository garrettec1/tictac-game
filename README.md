tictac-game
===========

A tic-tac-toe game I have been working on over the summer.

I took my first python class at school last quarter, and felt like I still
 had a lot to learn. I also wanted to start using version control, so this 
 is really my first attempt at using git and gut-hub. Pretty excited about
 it.

I am pretty sure I could have written this program much more easily and
 concisely by using a list for the boardInfo, instead of a dict, but I 
 really enjoyed the challenge, and wanted to play with dictionaries. 
 
A big thanks to Geoff Shannon my good friend and programming mentor.

Without his help and encouragement, this never would have happened.
